# SignalCloneDetection
 Here, we provide a python implementation of the [modified Signal protocol](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372297.3423354) proposed by Cremers et al. This implementation is provided in clone_detect.py.
 
 You can learn about the implementation by reading our [paper](report.pdf).
 
 To run the implementation, you'll need to install a few python packages, namely
 
 ```bash
 pip install pycryptodome
 pip install cryptology
 ```
